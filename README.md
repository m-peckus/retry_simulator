# Retry Simulator with Stripe API

This project is a learning exercise focused on implementing **retry logic** in Python when interacting with APIs that may return rate limit errors, specifically the **Stripe API**.

## Project Structure

retry_simulator/ ├── .env ├── main.py ├── utils/ │   └── retry_simulator.py ├── .gitignore └── requirements.txt

## Description

When working with external APIs, one common challenge is handling rate limits — restrictions set by API providers to control the number of requests in a given timeframe. This project simulates such conditions and implements retry logic using Python decorators.

You will find:
- A **decorator factory** to retry API calls when a `429 Too Many Requests` error is raised.
- An example of rapidly firing 100 requests to the Stripe API to simulate rate limiting.
- Use of environment variables to safely manage secret keys.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**  
3. **Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Create a `.env` file in the root folder**  
Add your Stripe API key:

STRIPE_API_KEY=your_test_key_here

5. **Run the script**

python utils/retry_simulator.py

## Key Concepts Practiced

- **Rate Limiting vs. Quotas**:
- *Rate limits* define how many requests you can make in a short time window.
- *Quotas* define how many total requests you're allowed in a longer period.

- **Retry Mechanism**:
- A retry decorator handles automatic retries for failed requests.
- Implements exponential backoff using increasing sleep intervals between retries.

- **Bucket Algorithms**:
- *Token Bucket* and *Leaky Bucket* strategies were studied as server-side control mechanisms.

- **Python Decorators**:
- Practiced writing reusable decorator factories for logic reuse and cleaner code.

## What I Learned

> Rate limiting is a defensive mechanism to protect APIs from excessive use or abuse — whether from legitimate bursts of client traffic or malicious DDoS attacks. By implementing rate limits, systems ensure fair distribution of resources and maintain performance.

> This project also helped me solidify my understanding of Python decorators and retry logic, and how to gracefully handle API failures with minimal disruption to the user experience.

## Notes

- Stripe’s test environment does not easily trigger rate limits under normal conditions. Although no 429 errors were triggered in this simulation, the retry logic is built and ready to respond if they occur.
- `.env` and `__pycache__` folders are ignored in version control.
